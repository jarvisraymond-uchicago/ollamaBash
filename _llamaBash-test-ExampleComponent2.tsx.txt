 This is a React component named `ExampleComponent2`. It renders a table row with expandable details for each row. The table columns include Concept ID, Concept Code, Concept Name, Concept Class ID, number of people with variable, number of people where value is filled, and number of people where value is null. Additionally, there are hidden cells containing the value stored as and an array of value summaries.

The expandable details contain a Grid layout with two columns. The left column displays data visualization information, such as a table showing the value as string, concept ID, concept name, and person count for each unique value in the dataset. It also shows additional information, such as minimum value, maximum value, mean value, and standard deviation.

The right column in the expandable details displays a JSON representation of the `valueSummary` array. The component uses classnames based on whether certain cells contain the search term to conditionally apply CSS styles.

It seems that this component is intended to be used within another component or page, as it does not have a `return` statement with a self-closing tag, such as `<div>` or `<React.Fragment>`. Instead, it returns a Fragment containing the table row and expandable details.
