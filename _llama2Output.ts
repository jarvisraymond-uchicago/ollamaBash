As a principal software engineer, I would suggest several improvements to the `TableRow` component:

1. Use type annotations for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm` should be annotated as `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm: (cellValue: string) => boolean`.
2. Use destructuring to simplify the `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm` function. Instead of having multiple lines of code to check if a cell contains the search term, you can use destructuring to extract the relevant parts and reduce the code size. For example, `const { searchInputValue, cellText } = rowObject;`
3. Use a consistent naming convention throughout the component. Some variables are camelCased (`rowObject`), while others are pascalCase (` columnsShown`). It's better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
4. Consider using a higher-order component (HOC) to improve the flexibility and reusability of the `TableRow` component. A HOC can help you decouple the rendering of the table row from the `Table` component, making it easier to reuse the row component in different contexts.
5. Add a `key` prop to each `td` element to ensure that the table is properly rendered and to avoid bugs caused by lack of keys.
6. Consider using a library like `react-use` or `react-hook-form` to manage form data and validation more efficiently. These libraries provide better support for handling complex form logic and validation than the `useState` hook alone.
7. Use type hints for function parameters to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, `const searchTermFound = checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm(cellText)` should be typed as `searchTermFound: (cellText: string) => boolean`.
8. Consider using a `useCallback` or `useMemo` hook to memoize the `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm` function, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
9. Use consistent spacing and indentation throughout the code to improve readability. For example, consistently use 4 spaces for indentation and keep the spacing between lines uniform.
10. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each component and how it fits into the overall application logic. This can help other developers understand the code better and reduce the time needed for onboarding.
