 It looks like you're rendering a `TableRow` component in React, given an object `rowObject`. The component seems to handle the expansion and collapse functionality of a row when clicking on it, as well as displaying data in the table cells and an expandable area below it.

The table columns are shown dynamically based on the number of items in the provided `columns` array. The search functionality is also present, with the `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm` function checking if a cell contains the search term before conditionally rendering additional classes for styling.

The component uses some utility functions like `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm`, `checkIfHiddenCellsContainSearchTerm`, and `checkIfChartContainsSearchTerm`. However, these functions are not defined in the given code snippet.

Here's a brief explanation of how the component works:

1. The table data is mapped to `TableRow` components using the `map` function.
2. Each `TableRow` receives its corresponding `rowObject` as a prop.
3. The `checkIfCellContainsSearchTerm`, `checkIfHiddenCellsContainSearchTerm`, and `checkIfChartContainsSearchTerm` functions are used to conditionally apply classes based on the search term presence in the cells.
4. The expandable functionality is implemented by setting a state variable `showDetails` that toggles between true and false when clicking the expand/collapse button in each row.
5. When expanding a row, the data visualization and additional information are displayed below it.
6. The component also uses React's Grid system for layout and Material-UI Tables for rendering the table data.
